// Companion to discovery-files-no-pricing.test.ts / discovery-files-no-claims.test.ts.
//
// The static discovery files under public/ hardcode the site origin in absolute
// URLs (homepage links, API endpoints, .well-known pointers, sitemap). They are
// swapped by hand at a domain cutover (the milk.market → self-sown.com cutover
// used sed), and the other discovery tests only check CONTENT claims — nothing
// cross-checked the advertised domain against the configured site URL. A future
// cutover that misses a file, or a partial edit, would silently ship discovery
// files pointing agents and crawlers at the wrong origin.
//
// Policy enforced here for every absolute http(s) URL in each discovery file:
//
//   1. URLs on the configured site host (resolveExpectedHost()) are correct.
//   2. URLs on LEGACY_SITE_HOST are allowed ONLY as historical references —
//      an operational endpoint path (/api/*, /.well-known/*) on the legacy
//      host is stale cutover drift and fails: legacy page URLs still resolve
//      (the old domain is served as platform traffic), but a legacy API
//      endpoint advertised to agents rots the moment the domain is dropped.
//   3. URLs on EXTERNAL_HOST_ALLOWLIST are legitimate external references.
//   4. ANY other host fails as an unrecognized origin: it is either a stale
//      site domain from a partial cutover, a typo'd domain, or a new external
//      link that must be explicitly allowlisted. This "default-deny" is what
//      makes the guard flip cleanly when NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL changes: the
//      old site domain becomes unrecognized the moment the configured host
//      moves, with no domain hardcoded anywhere in this test.
//
// Additionally every discovery file must reference its own configured origin
// at least once, so a wholesale wrong-domain sed cannot pass.
