// Inverse drift guard to llms-full-price-sync.test.ts.
//
// Membership pricing belongs ONLY in the rich-content surfaces that enumerate
// tiers (`public/llms-full.txt` and `utils/geo/page-content.ts`), kept in
// lockstep with `utils/pro/constants.ts`. The "pure discovery/transport"
// files served to AI agents describe MCP transport, scopes, rate limits, A2A
// skills, and shop products — membership tiers are NOT applicable there.
// (See memory: machine-readable-tier-surfaces.md.)
//
// Nothing stops someone from accidentally pasting a price like "$21" or
// "$2,100" into one of those discovery files, where it would drift
// independently of utils/pro/constants.ts and silently go stale, handing
// agents wrong numbers. This test asserts the canonical price strings are
// ABSENT from every pure-discovery surface, naming the file that picked one up.
//
// The canonical price strings are derived from utils/pro/constants.ts using the
// same fmtUsd helper as llms-full-price-sync.test.ts, so they always reflect
// the real prices.
