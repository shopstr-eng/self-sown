/**
 * Per-segment blog broadcast behavior (#154): the same published post version
 * can be emailed once to popup contacts, once to subscription contacts, and
 * once to the full audience — but a contact must NEVER receive the same
 * version twice. Dedup is driven by the immutable per-recipient ledger
 * (blog_email_broadcast_recipients), NOT by current segment membership,
 * because a capture's source is mutable (subscription -> popup when they
 * later claim a welcome offer). runBlogBroadcast runs for real; the DB +
 * SendGrid layer is mocked at the module boundary.
