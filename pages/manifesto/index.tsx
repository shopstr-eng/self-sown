  "Our food systems are f*cked. Yes, f*cked.",
  "To start, our relationship with food has been bastardized to such an extent that grocery stores and fast food chains act on the same playbook: gaming your desire for a quick fix and encouraging the consumption of so-called food for their benefit. Our health and needs aren't a priority. And for those individuals that try to go out of their way and have the ability to sustain a healthy lifestyle, most \"healthy\" or \"sustainable\" grocery stores greenwash and slap shiny certifications on the products they stock in the hopes we avoid looking at the actual labels or at their sourcing, seeing what's really in-store for us. Now don't get me wrong, there are a lot of areas of the market, such as co-ops or local grocery stores, that do go out of their way to make those direct connections with their farmers and ensure high standards, but those are few and far between when compared to the stores we as consumers have access to and knowledge about (and frankly they still don't move the needle quite as much as is needed for food producers in terms of survival). There is a lot, and I mean A LOT, of room for improvement.",
  "Animal treatment and conditions are also a massive issue. Food production businesses are greatly supported by scale, but with that we often see animals forced into dark boxes, being fed slop that even prisoners wouldn't eat, all while never being able to even have a comfortable place to rest. This not only translates into unhappy animals, but the treatment they face passes through to us via their respective products, giving us back nutritionally vacant steaks, poisonous plants, dead milk, and the like. Even the crops are mistreated, being sprayed down with a cocktail of chemicals containing god-knows-what genetic modification making them closer to mutant animals than actual plants, being grown with practices that destroy the soil and leave our land barren over time.",
  "With all of this taken into account, we see 77 local farms close every day. Every. Single. Day. Farmers have been pushed back so far out from the sales cycle that even if the government mandated that farmers give their food away for free, it would only affect the price of goods by around 9 cents.",
  'Milk in particular is what has brought me to this point of contention against our current food system. Raw milk, the milk of our ancestors having been drunk for centuries, is one of the most regulatorily divisive drinks one can purchase and consume, if you\'re even able to. In countries we generally consider "developed" like Canada, Australia, or Singapore, raw milk is completely outlawed. In my home country, the United States, it\'s a federal crime to cross state lines with raw milk for sale. Even within the states that do allow its sale, the regulatory bodies do their best to limit its distribution, allowing only on-farm sales, herdshare agreements, or legal loopholes like "pet food" or "cosmetic use" labeling. And when these regulations "aren\'t followed" or are rather deemed as not being followed, the government bodies that regulate these products have even come to resort to raids with guns drawn, as if your local farmer and co-op are mafia members or kingpins. Milk, of all things, is treated like a Schedule I substance. Meanwhile you can find used needles and heroin dealers in some of the biggest cities across the western world, often with little to no repercussions or action to make this better.',
  "Progress is limited when bureaucrats think the best way to protect or move society forward is by sticking their hands in everything and regulating markets to hell. This is what causes the breakdowns in our supply chains and food shipments. We see people arguing online about which side of a war is morally superior (as if war had any morality associated with it), worrying about crises abroad and political division at home, when the one thing we take for granted that could very easily be restricted is our access to food. Modern city planning has laid out divisions of society where we can't even comprehend how our food ends up on our plate. The view of farming as a vocation and craft has been flipped on its head, now seen as unworthy of someone with visions of success or ambition. Farms are pushed so far out of our lives that driving to the outskirts of a city to shake our farmers' hands feels more like an inconvenience rather than the beautiful development of community that it is (and without even mentioning the immense amount of knowledge, intuition, engineering, and wisdom that goes into our food production). And if one is able to make their way out to learn and dive into the work, the cost of land, equipment, loans, and especially licenses and the burden of regulations can entirely derail that development. Such a loss of appreciation and consideration for the most important work done by our species. Even Prophets, Presidents, and CEOs need to eat.",
  "Technology and its applications, I believe, are our most powerful tools against this regulatory creep and capture. Digital infrastructure in particular, which can be so often overlooked by our producer community, can make the enforcement and application of unjust laws much less feasible and costly for government bodies and agents. Our communication channels are up front as primary vehicles to coordinate and come together to organize ourselves. In the context of farming, communication allows us to create buyer's clubs, co-ops, or simply find pickup spots to get the food we so choose. If all of this is being done on the open Internet, with platforms that serve their advertisers and governments, not their users, then we're encouraging the inevitable fist of control to come down on us. Encryption serves as the first line of defense against tyranny, protecting our speech and protecting our communities by not allowing prying eyes to see the information we don't wish for them to see, and that they frankly don't have the right or need to see.",
  "And, most apparently but often not so obviously, chief among these technologies is money. It is the greatest tool for aligning our interests and serving our work, and when it comes to facilitating the proliferation of truly free markets and direct producer-to-consumer transactions, Bitcoin is the purest technological realization of money. Banks \"keep our money safe\" and connect us to commercial activity, but when push comes to shove, they'll give up on any and all customers they have that don't serve their bottom line. We've seen it time and time again: bank runs and bailouts that don't help anyone but those responsible for causing the trouble in the first place, leaving those of us who parked our cash with so-called trusted institutions high and dry. Monetary policy is a key part in the decline of the small farmer more than most realize. The system is designed to reward extractive debasement of labor and squeeze the lifeblood out of the sacred work: that of our hands. Not necessarily maliciously, but most definitely systematically, the value of our dollar earned is degraded in value such that small operations are becoming much less sustainable over time. \"A penny saved is a penny earned\" in this day and age is better said as \"a dollar saved is a penny earned\" (or even a penny lost!). Inflation is a silent killer that you don't realize is affecting you until you wake up one day and are worried about how you're going to put food on your family's table. With Bitcoin, we can take back our sovereignty and independence from the financial shackles banks have forced us into, with high fees galore, limited control over our own money, and direct access into all of our spending habits. Bitcoin is a technology to protect our wealth, our time, supersede the state, and defend our freedom to buy whatever damn food we want. Few.",
  "Ultimately these markets, our food markets, and the tools we choose to build them with are fundamental to our organization as a world, as nations and as communities. Without free and open food markets, we lose the very foundation of what has allowed humanity to survive and thrive. Our inalienable right and freedom to choose what we as creatures of the earth produce and consume from said earth is at risk of being captured by the monolith of regulation, bureaucracy, and the state. It is up to us as a collective to fight back and protect one of our most sacred resources, food, with our greatest weapon, community. May we live free or leave a mark on the world while trying.",
