# Dev-preview server: memory-bounded production build, then serve standalone.
#
# Why this wrapper exists: a cold Turbopack production build of this app
# (Next 16.3.4) used to peak at ~6.5-7GB against an ~8GiB VM with ~2GB of
# baseline usage outside our control, so builds died with SIGKILL (exit 137,
# or a misleading PostCSS "unexpected end of file" panic) many times in a
# row. The dominant cause turned out to be Tailwind v4's automatic source
# detection scanning the multi-GB .local/ and .cache/ directories during the
# globals.css compile (~4.4GB of the peak); globals.css now pins explicit
# @source globs (source(none)) and a cold build peaks at ~2.4GB. next.config
# also trims dev-build memory (see the SS_DEV_BUILD block — notably the
# Turbopack FS build cache is disabled). Host memory noise still fluctuates,
# so this supervisor keeps the safety nets:
#
#  1. Bind port 5000 IMMEDIATELY with a tiny status page (workflow port check
#     passes in seconds instead of timing out at 300s mid-build; if a
#     last-good bundle exists it is served instead so the preview is never
#     dead).
#  2. Memory gate + IDE kill: cold builds wait (up to WAIT_TIMEOUT_S) until
#     enough memory is free, and kill the IDE's TypeScript language servers
#     (~1.5-2.5GB, respawn lazily) when memory is tight.
#  3. Retries: SIGKILL-class failures (137/139/134) get MAX_ATTEMPTS initial
#     attempts; host memory noise fluctuates minute to minute, so a later
#     attempt often fits where an earlier one didn't.
#  4. Self-heal: if the initial attempts all OOM, keep retrying in the
#     background every RETRY_INTERVAL_S; when one finally fits, the status
#     page / last-good server is swapped for the fresh build automatically.
#     A REAL compile error (exit 1 etc.) stops the loop and flips the status
#     page to "broken" — it needs a code fix, not more attempts.
