# Regression tests for scripts/deploy-build.sh (the Autoscale deploy build).

#
#   bash scripts/deploy-build.test.sh
#
# Pins the bundle-assembly step the same way scripts/dev-server.test.sh pins
# the preview supervisor: the REAL scripts/prepare-standalone.mjs is copied
# into the sandbox (only its Sharp-repair dependency is stubbed), so a drift
# in deploy-build.sh's invocation — wrong flag, wrong cwd, skipped call — or
# in the real script's CLI/output layout fails here instead of shipping a
# publish bundle missing static assets or with broken image optimization.
#
#   A. Happy path      -> assembly delegated with --strict-sharp, real script
#                         folds .next/static + public/ into the bundle, the
#                         rest of the build (cleanup, runtime bundle) runs
#   B. Sharp failure   -> --strict-sharp exits the build non-zero BEFORE the
#                         post-build cleanup (fail-loud contract)
#   C. Missing bundle  -> a build that produced no standalone server.js fails
#                         loudly too (guards against `|| true` creeping onto
#                         the assembly call)
#   D. Node download   -> the portable-Node tarball is checksum-verified
#                         before extraction; a matching download is bundled
#   E. Checksum mismatch -> a corrupted/tampered tarball fails the build
#                         loudly and is never extracted into the bundle
#   F. Stale pin       -> a SHASUMS256.txt that disagrees with the pinned
#                         NODE_SHA256 (someone bumped NODE_VERSION without the
#                         pin) fails the build with the update-together
#                         message, before any extraction
#   G. Missing entry   -> a SHASUMS256.txt with NO entry for the tarball
#                         filename (typo'd NODE_VERSION, wrong arch suffix, or
#                         a pulled release) fails the build with the
#                         not-found message, before any extraction
#   H. Guard           -> without the publish-only marker the script refuses
#                         to run and deletes nothing
#   I. Node drift      -> a .nvmrc major that disagrees with the bundled
#                         NODE_VERSION fails the build before any install or
#                         build (published runtime must be the major the repo
#                         builds and tests on)
#   J. Missing .nvmrc  -> without the .nvmrc source of truth the build fails
#                         loudly instead of guessing
