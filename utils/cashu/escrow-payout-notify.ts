// Post-finalize "your escrow payout arrived" notification.
//
// Payout delivery is pull-only (the payee polls the status endpoint from the
// orders page), so a payee who never opens the app never learns their escrow
// resolved. After the outbox entry is finalized, the payout worker sends the
// payee a gift-wrapped Nostr DM (signed by the server's ENCRYPTION_NSEC
// identity) delivered to the PAYEE's own NIP-65 read relays — the same
// seller-relay delivery pattern as order DMs.
//
// Custody rule (docs/cashu-escrow-threat-model.md): the message references
// the escrow id and the resolution ONLY — never the payout token. The
// P2PK-locked payout proofs stay behind the status endpoint, which the payee
// redeems from their orders page.
//
// Delivery is best-effort: a false return or a throw means the DM did not
// go out; the payout itself is already final and is NEVER retried or rolled
// back because of a notification failure.
