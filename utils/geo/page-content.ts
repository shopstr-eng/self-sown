Self-sown is the online store built for farmers, food makers, and artisan producers who are tired of handing over 2.9% and 30 cents per sale plus $39 to $2,300 a month just to run their own store.

Because it runs on Nostr, an open and decentralized network, your store and customer list belong to you, and no one can freeze your account or shut you down.

## What you can buy and sell
Farm-fresh produce, meat, eggs, dairy, baked goods, honey, preserves, and other local and handmade goods.

## Payments
Bitcoin over the Lightning Network, Cashu ecash, cards (Stripe or Square), and manual fiat (Venmo, Cash App, Zelle, and more). Sellers get paid directly, with no mandatory platform fees.

    markdown: `# About Self-sown

Self-sown connects local food producers directly with buyers through a permissionless, censorship-resistant marketplace built on the **Nostr protocol**.

Anyone can become a producer without asking permission. Listings live on Nostr relays, so no single company can remove a producer from the network. The marketplace serves local food and artisan goods broadly: meat, eggs, produce, dairy, baked goods, honey, preserves, and handmade goods.

## Why it exists
To rebuild local and decentralized food supply chains, giving producers a direct, sovereign channel to their customers and giving buyers transparent access to local food, paid for with open money (Bitcoin) or familiar methods (cards, fiat).

      "The essay behind Self-sown: why our food systems are broken, and how free markets, encryption, and Bitcoin let producers and communities take food back.",
    markdown: `# Free Food Manifesto

This is a machine-readable summary. The authoritative essay is rendered at [${SITE}/manifesto](${SITE}/manifesto).

Our food systems are broken: grocery chains game convenience, greenwashed labels hide sourcing, animals and soil are mistreated, and 77 local farms close every day while regulation pushes producers out of the sales cycle. Small farms and artisan producers are regulated as if they were industrial plants, and selling directly to your own community is restricted or permit-gated across much of the developed world.

The essay argues that technology is the strongest tool against this regulatory capture: encrypted communication (Nostr) to organize buyers, co-ops, and pickup spots without platform surveillance, and Bitcoin as sound money for direct producer-to-consumer trade without banks or debasement.

Free and open food markets are the foundation of thriving communities; defending them takes community. — Cristian Alvarez-Hernandez, Founder @ Self-sown`,

    markdown: `# Self-sown FAQ

**What can I sell?** Local food and goods of all kinds — meat, eggs, produce, dairy, baked goods, honey, preserves, and handmade goods.

**How do payments work?** Bitcoin (Lightning, Cashu ecash), card payments (Stripe or Square), and manual fiat. Buyers can check out as a guest with just an email, or with their own Nostr keys.

**Is it really permissionless?** Yes. Listings are Nostr events on open relays; there is no central approval step.

**How is my data handled?** Orders and messages are end-to-end encrypted (NIP-17). The platform caches public listings in PostgreSQL for search and fast page loads.

**Can AI agents use Self-sown?** Yes, via the Model Context Protocol server at \`${SITE}/api/mcp\`. See [/llms.txt](${SITE}/llms.txt) and [/skill.md](${SITE}/skill.md).`,

    markdown: `# Producer Guide

How to start selling local food and goods on Self-sown.

1. **Create your account** with a Nostr identity (new or existing).
2. **Choose your membership**: a free plan with unlimited listings, Herd ($21/month or $168/year, saving 33%) with a 30-day free trial for new sellers, or Wrangler (one-time $2,100) for lifetime access to every Herd feature, plus the option to self-host a private, single-tenant copy of your store on your own server.
3. **List your first product**: title, description, price, images, categories, shipping, pickup, variants, and bulk pricing.
4. **Manage orders & communication** through encrypted buyer chat.
5. **Customize your storefront** (Herd): colors, fonts, page builder, SEO/OG meta, and a custom domain.
6. **Automate your email flows** (Herd): welcome series, order follow-ups, re-engagement, with open, click, and conversion analytics for every flow and one-time send. You can also send these emails (plus order confirmations) from your own SendGrid-authenticated domain; if your domain isn't verified, sending automatically falls back to the platform's verified sender so messages always go out. Analytics are private to each seller: every request is scoped to the seller's own account, so no other seller can see them and the platform does not access an individual seller's raw email analytics.
7. **Buy shipping labels** (Herd): connect your own Shippo account, quote live rates, buy labels, and issue returns from the orders dashboard.
8. **Connect AI agents with MCP** (Herd) so autonomous agents can manage listings and orders — or chat with the built-in AI seller assistant (Settings > AI Assistant), which drives the same MCP tools.
9. **Grow your business**: update listings, build relationships, share your story, and expand reach.

To accept card payments, connect either Stripe or Square (one card processor per stall, your choice). If you connect a Stripe account, you can also turn on automatic US sales tax (free). Stripe calculates it from the buyer's shipping address and shows it at checkout on card orders.
