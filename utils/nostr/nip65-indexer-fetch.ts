/**
 * Live NIP-65 (kind 10002) lookup for pubkeys whose relay list is missing
 * from the Postgres cache. Server-side delivery paths (order/payout gift
 * wraps) fall back to this so a payee's own read relays are still targeted
 * instead of relying on default-relay/blastr federation luck — federation
 * masked cache misses in staging but is not a delivery guarantee (a payee on
 * a small or private relay would silently miss the DM).
 *
 * Each indexer is queried through its own contained socket (see
 * contained-relay.ts): one slow/unreachable indexer can neither discard a
 * reachable indexer's results nor leak a dangling socket error.
