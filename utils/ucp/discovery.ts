/**
 * Builder for the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) discovery profile served at
 * `/.well-known/ucp`. Pure and synchronous so it can be unit-tested for both the
 * platform-wide (aggregate) and seller-scoped variants without a request.
 *
 * The profile is the entry point an agentic/shopping client reads to learn:
 *   - which UCP capabilities this host supports (catalog + checkout),
 *   - the concrete REST endpoints + machine-readable schema/spec for each,
 *   - the accepted payment methods, and
 *   - vendor (Nostr/MCP) extensions under the reverse-DNS namespace.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   - Platform host → an *aggregate* profile describing the whole marketplace.
 *   - A seller's custom domain (or a self-host instance) → a *seller-scoped*
 *     profile naming the one seller; the catalog/checkout endpoints are the same
 *     relative paths but resolve to that seller because they're served on the
 *     seller's host (the proxy scopes them by host).
