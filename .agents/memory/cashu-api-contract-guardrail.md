description: Why mocked Send/Mint tests can't catch @cashu/cashu-ts upgrades, and the contract test that does
---

The send-button/mint-button Jest suites mock `@cashu/cashu-ts` entirely, so a
library upgrade that renames or removes a Wallet method keeps those suites GREEN
while the real flows break at runtime (e.g. "loadMint is not a function" after
methods drifted to `loadMint` + the `*Bolt11` names). tsc does NOT catch this for
the mocks because mock objects are `jest.fn()` cast through `any`.

**Rule:** keep a contract test that imports the REAL library (no `jest.mock`) and
asserts every Wallet/Mint/KeyChain method + top-level export the Send/Mint flows
depend on still exists (prototype methods, `keyChain` getter, offline
constructability). It lives in `components/wallet/__tests__/cashu-api-contract.test.ts`.

**Why:** mocked behavioral tests verify our logic but are blind to upstream API
drift; the contract test is the only thing that fails fast on a bad upgrade.

**How to apply:** on any `@cashu/cashu-ts` (or wallet-lib) bump, run the contract
test. If it goes red, update the wallet component/util to the new API AND update
the mocks in send-button.test.tsx / mint-button.test.tsx in the same change. If a
Send/Mint flow starts calling a new library method, add it to the contract test.
The methods currently guarded: loadMint, send, checkProofsStates,
createMintQuoteBolt11, checkMintQuoteBolt11, mintProofsBolt11, the keyChain
getter, KeyChain.getKeysets, and getEncodedToken.

v4 semantics that bit real flows (guard with real-library round-trip tests, not
mocks): `getDecodedToken` throws without the second keysets arg (pass `[]`);
decoded proofs carry `Amount` objects that JSON-serialize as strings (normalize
to ints before wire transfer); `signP2PKProofs` only attaches refund-key
witnesses after the locktime expires and swallows per-proof failures into log
warnings (verify witnesses landed yourself).

**Blind spot — method-EXISTS ≠ method-CALLED:** the contract test only asserts the
library methods exist; it can't see whether a call site actually invokes them in
the right order. cashu-ts v4 requires `await wallet.loadMint()` on a freshly
constructed `CashuWallet` BEFORE `createMintQuoteBolt11()`, or the mint quote
throws "Mint info not initialized; call loadMint or loadMintFromCache first". The
buyer checkout invoice cards (`product-invoice-card.tsx` +
`cart-invoice-card.tsx`) forgot that call in their Lightning + NWC handlers, so
Bitcoin invoices silently failed to generate (handler catch → `invoiceGenerationFailed`)
for perfectly valid price/currency — past the green contract test. Guarded now by
a source-invariant test (`__tests__/components/invoice-card-loadmint-invariant.test.ts`)
asserting every `createMintQuoteBolt11(` in those cards is preceded by a
`.loadMint(` on the wallet it was built from. Wallet buttons + the UCP/MCP
order-service path already loadMint correctly; the checkout cards were the gap.

**Custom transports must use JSONInt, not JSON:** when supplying
`customRequest` to `new CashuMint(url, { customRequest })`, serialize request
bodies with the SDK's own `JSONInt.stringify` and parse responses with
`JSONInt.parse`. Cashu `Amount.toJSON()` emits QUOTED strings while the wire
protocol expects numeric amounts — plain `JSON.stringify` produces melt
requests real mints reject, and every mock-based test stays green because the
mocks never serialize. Error mapping contract: `{code, detail}` bodies →
`MintOperationError`, other non-2xx → `HttpResponseError`, or the SDK's retry
logic misclassifies failures. A customRequest transport's wire contract can
only be regression-tested with the REAL SDK (real Amount/JSONInt/error
classes, only the fetch boundary mocked) — mock-based suites stay green
through SDK drift. Apply that pattern to any new customRequest transport.
